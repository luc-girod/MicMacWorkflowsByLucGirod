# MicMacWorkflowsByLucGirod

This repository includes workflows for MicMac (and usually a bit of GDAL at the end), created by Luc Girod.

Find MicMac here : https://github.com/micmacIGN/micmac/

This repository is a work in progress as I try to provide the most automated and fool-proof scripts, not only my dirty ones that need tempering for each dataset ;)

A stub of doc for this repo is here https://micmacworkflowsbylucgirod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ 

The MicMac wiki can also help you (for some reason only with Firefox) : http://micmac.ensg.eu

The community is on Reddit : https://www.reddit.com/r/MicMac/
